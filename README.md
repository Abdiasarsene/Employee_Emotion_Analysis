# Employee Emotion Analysis

## 📌 Description  
This project aims to analyze employee well-being through internal surveys and anonymized exchanges (Slack, Teams, emails). The goal is to identify dominant emotions (stress, satisfaction, frustration, etc.) and provide recommendations to improve workplace quality of life.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Text analysis and NLP  
- **NLTK / SpaCy**: Text preprocessing  
- **VADER Sentiment/NRCLex**: Emotion classification  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Data visualization  
- **Pandas / NumPy**: Data manipulation
