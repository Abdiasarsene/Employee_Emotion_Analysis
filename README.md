# Employee Emotion Analysis

## 📌 Description  
This project aims to analyze employee well-being through internal surveys and anonymized exchanges (Slack, Teams, emails). The goal is to identify dominant emotions (stress, satisfaction, frustration, etc.) and provide recommendations to improve workplace quality of life.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Text analysis and NLP  
- **NLTK / SpaCy**: Text preprocessing  
- **Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa)**: Emotion classification  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly**: Data visualization  
- **Pandas / NumPy**: Data manipulation  
- **Scikit-learn**: Model evaluation

## 📊 Methodology  
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering and anonymizing survey responses and messages.  
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal.  
3. **Emotion Analysis**: Using NLP models to classify emotions.  
4. **Visualization**: Trends over time, word clouds, heatmaps.  
5. **Recommendations**: Providing insights for workplace well-being improvement.
